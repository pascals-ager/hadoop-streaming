Space and Time Complexity:
--------------------------
Given N key - v alue pairs,
Time complexity is O(N * R) when a single mapper and reducer task is used. Where R is the number of connections (at the degree being calculated. Higher the degree, the connection space increases)
However for extremely large datasets, with moderate levelof cardinality, map and reduce phases can be run in parallel as each stage operates on its own data (k -v) and tries to breakdown the
problem for the next stage without having to rely on global state

Space complexity: The map-reduce model uses file streams and avoids large in-memory data structures. Theoretically, the map stage deals with
one k-v pair a time, making it O(1) but the reduce phase implementation, aggregates(unions) the connection nodes (set) per key, theoretically, taking the
complexity upto O(R) where R is the max number of connections a node can have. As  higher degree of relationships is calculated, the k - v pair becomes larger.
Currently, the data structures used for k - v pairs are not lazy and the values(v) are modeled immutable. so a mutable copy of the values are created and used for
implementing the 'logic' in the map stage.

Network Complexity: N Reads and Writes per map/reduce/shuffle stage.


Correctness:
------------

1. Map stage:

for k -> V, where V = {v1, v2, ..} :
    if V is set of Single element - v, then, include v -> {k} in k -> V processing// This captures the bi-directional relationship

    send_to_sort(k, V)

    for v in V:
        # capture connections between elements of V
        # In the first map stage, this captures 1 st degree connections
        # In the second map stage, the second degree and so on
        # Essentially adding more k - V pairs for reduction stage to aggregate
        #k -> V = v -> V - {v}
        send_to_sort(v, V - {v})


2. Sort and shuffle keys
    Each reducer theoretically gets k - V pairs for one K

3. Reducer Stage:

    Simple group by key, union over V, to get all the connection for the key

When chained together, we can compose N-degree solutions by operating on a k - V pair at a time per stage.
